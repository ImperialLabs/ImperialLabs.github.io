## Design Overview

SLAPI Bot (The ChatOps Framework) strives to accomplish is a truly code base agnostic approach to utilizing Bots and ChatOps.

How is this different than other Bots?

* No requirement to use same code base or import a specific library
* Utilizes Docker as a package management system
* Handles routing and plugin management within the framework
* The only requirements are very simple simple data endpoints laid out here (coming soon)
